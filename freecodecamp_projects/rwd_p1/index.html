                <p>Red Bull GmbH is an Austrian private company known for its range of energy drinks. It is also known for its sponsorship of a range of sporting events and teams. </p>
                <p>
                    Originally, the energy drink Red Bull was inspired by an existing energy drink, Krating Daeng, which was introduced in Thailand, modified the ingredients to suit the tastes of Westerners, then founded Red Bull GmbH in 1984 in Fuschl am See, Austria.
                </p>
                <p>The company's English slogan is <strong>"Red Bull gives you wings"</strong>. Rather than following a traditional marketing approach, they have generated awareness and created a <em>"brand myth"</em> through proprietary extreme sport event series such as Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series, Red Bull Air Race, Red Bull Crashed Ice and standout stunts such as the Stratos space diving project.
